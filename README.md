 # ATM Machine


# Introduction:-   
 The ATM Program in C is written in C programming language which provides an ease to read and comprehend the instructions used. 
This program for using ATM machine is built on the concept of handling an account individually.

It can be defined as actually simple code structure of ATM transaction process to be understood by a user. 
For implementing this project, we may have to use function but in the meantime for easy coding, we may have to switch cause statement.

From this ATM program in C, we can even use the mini-program for checking the total balance, depositing the amount, and withdrawing the amount from the account definitely since it is not time overwhelming.

# Syntax: 

The C program executes ATM transaction having 5 forms of coding syntax:

1. Account balance checking
2. ATM Cash withdrawal
3. Deposition of cash
4.Transfer money
5. Change pin

# The process syntax structure includes the following procedures: 

1) Initially, we need to adjust or set the ATM pin along with the amount including a few random numbers.
2) Taking ATM pin as the input.
3) If the provided input pin is identical to the adjusted pin, then after that we can perform additional operations.
4) We will implement the switch statement for executing the operations such as checking balance, withdrawal of cash amount, deposition of cash, and so on.
5) Also, using a while loop to resume or terminate the procedure.

# How ATM program work in C? 

The ATM program follows 5 processes for proper transaction logically that includes cash withdrawing, depositing, and checking balance, change pin and transfer money. 
This five-program sections are executed using the switch cases in C with initialized variables and functions with conditions. 
The conditions provide results accurately only if they are satisfied.
For example, using the ATM program in C, if the balance in the bank account is sufficient then only the withdrawal process will be proceeded otherwise go for another transaction or check the balance through options. 
Also, when a user deposits some amount into the account then on executing the code part, the ATM program will show the new balance present in the account. 
In the third technique, the user can check his/her account balance when the user performs any withdrawal or deposition actions through ATM transaction.

# Conclusion
Programming in C is perfect for beginners to code and therefore before proceeding it is essential to gain a few basic codes of C programming.

For creating an ATM machine program using C, we need to implement the six fundamental concepts of each ATM system that exists. 
it includes cash withdraw, cash deposit, account balance checks, change pin, transfer money and functionality for another transaction or termination.
